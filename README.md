## REST API :-
An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.

## MongoDB :-
MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL (Not only SQL) is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information. It stores data in a type of JSON format called BSON.A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of key value pairs similar to the structure of JSON objects.
